        An Encoder can be configured to use an instance of this, and will use it to abbreviate keys
        that are given to it as strings.

        The Dict class does _not_ use this; it has no outside context to be able to find shared
        state such as this object. The client is responsible for using this object to map between
        string and integer keys when using Dicts that were encoded this way.

        implement the actual persistence. */
